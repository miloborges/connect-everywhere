# Connect Everywhere

Ad-free, donation-funded community map of public WiFi spots (Amsterdam-first).

## What it does
Connect Everywhere helps people discover and share public WiFi at cafés, libraries, and public spaces. [file:29]

## How it works
- Add a spot (pin + WiFi name; password only if the venue authorizes sharing). [file:29]
- Community voting keeps info accurate: +10 net votes = Verified badge; -10 = flagged/hidden. [file:29]
- Passwords are revealed only after a user contributes (adds 1 spot). [file:29]

## Why this exists
Reliable connectivity is a basic utility. This project keeps public WiFi info up-to-date through community verification. [file:29]

## Support
Donations keep this project running (no ads). See: https://www.connect-everywhere.org
